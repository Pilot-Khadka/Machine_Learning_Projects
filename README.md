## Overview

This repository contains various machine learning projects, each implemented in Python. Each project is designed to be standalone, with their own set of dependencies and instructions.

## Projects

### Web Scraping from News site (Ekantipur)

This project scrapes news articles from the Ekantipur website. The scraped data can be used for various natural language processing tasks or as a dataset for other machine learning projects.

- **Directory:** `Data_scraping`
- **Key Libraries:** `os`, `json`, `requests`, `pandas`, `BeautifulSoup`

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

The project showcases dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis on the Fashion MNIST dataset. It includes visualization of the transformed data and explanations of the variance captured by the principal components.

- **Directory:** `PCA-Fashion MNIST`
- **Key Libraries:** `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`

### Decision Tree

This project involves the implementation of a Decision Tree classifier for credit score classification. It includes training the model on a dataset, visualizing the tree, and evaluating its performance.

- **Directory:** `Decision Tree-Credit score classification`
- **Key Libraries:** `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`

### K-means Clustering

The K-means Clustering project demonstrates the clustering technique to find mineral composition. It includes visualizations of the clusters and evaluation of the clustering performance.

- **Directory:** `K-Means-Mineal Composition`
