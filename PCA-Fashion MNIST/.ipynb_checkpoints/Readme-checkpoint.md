The exponential growth of data generation poses a significant challenge. Managing and extracting useful information from vast amount of data is crucial across various domains, including business, industry, medicine and more.However, both humans and computers are overwhelmed by the sheer volume and intricacy of the data. Given the limitations in resources and the recognition that not all features are equally significant, feature selection plays a vital role in the data processing pipeline. Principal component analysis(PCA) is one of the dimensionality reduction technique which helps to identify the representation of raw data with fewer components.This allows for a more focused analysis, avoiding unnecessary compu- tational burden. Here, We study the application of PCA on random dataset and Iris dataset. Leveraging the insights obtained, we applied it to Fashion-MNIST dataset with much higher dimensions. For validating the obtained results, we compared classification report and reconstruction quality of the datasets.
